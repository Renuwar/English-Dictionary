191. Threat Intelligence: Information about cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious actors collected from various sources, such as security research, threat feeds, and incident reports, used to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks and improve threat detection and response capabilities.
192. Tokenization: The process of replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identifiers, with unique symbols or tokens that have no intrinsic value and cannot be reverse-engineered to obtain the original data, used for secure data storage, transmission, and processing.
193. Tor (The Onion Router): A free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication and browsing on the internet by routing data through a distributed network of volunteer-operated servers (nodes) to conceal the user's IP address and online activities from surveillance and censorship.
194. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): A security mechanism that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity and access a system, service, or application, typically combining something they know (such as a password) with something they have (such as a mobile device or security token).
195. UI/UX Design: The process of designing and enhancing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of digital products and interfaces to make them intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use, incorporating principles of usability, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.
196. Virtual Private Network (VPN): A secure network connection established over a public network, such as the internet, allowing users to send and receive data securely as if their devices were directly connected to a private network.
197. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol): A technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over the internet using IP networks, allowing users to make phone calls, send messages, and conduct video conferences using internet-connected devices.
198. Vulnerability Assessment: The process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications, using automated tools and manual techniques to assess risk, evaluate exposure, and recommend remediation measures.
199. Web Application Firewall (WAF): A security appliance or software solution that monitors and filters HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a web application and the internet, protecting against common web-based attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
200. Web Development: The process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications using programming languages, frameworks, and tools optimized for the World Wide Web, including front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.
201. Web Server: A software application or hardware device that stores, processes, and delivers web content and services to users over the internet, responding to client requests, managing sessions, and serving static and dynamic web pages using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
202. Web Scraping: The automated process of extracting data from websites and web pages using software tools or scripts, commonly used for data mining, market research, content aggregation, and competitive intelligence.
